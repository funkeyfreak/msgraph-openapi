      description: A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy. T&C policiesâ€™ contents are presented to users upon their first attempt to enroll into Intune and subsequently upon edits where an administrator has required re-acceptance. They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
